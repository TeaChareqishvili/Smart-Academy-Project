# Smart-Academy-Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a collaboration with a startup company. My primary responsibility was to create the user interface for five key pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These pages were designed to be responsive and visually appealing, aligning with the overall design and functionality requirements set by the startup.
